Hi, my name is Bruno Longo and I live in Brazil. 

I work as QA for almost 10 years now. 

During this time I already worked as a manual QA, Tech Lead, QA Coordinator, QA Automation Engineer and QA Architect.

At this moment I'm working as a QA Automation Engineer (or Senior Quality Engineer) and Automation Architect Engineer.

My background on multiple clients and with big international companies made me a great problem solver and conflicts manager.

I created this blog to share a little of my knowledge with others and help to improve other's QA's automation skills.

It is important to let you guys know this blog will not have a tutorial of some framework or guides on how to start, those can be easily found on the web and it is not purpose here.
